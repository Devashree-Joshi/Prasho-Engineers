        <h2> Our Story </h2>
        <p>Prasho Engineers is the brainchild of Late Mr. Prakash Laxman Kolhatkar and was established in June 1982. Jaydee Enterprises, a sister concern of Prasho was also established soon after in 1986. 
        <br>As a novice in the field of chemical and industrial processing, Mr. Prakash L. Kolhatkar started our industrial processing unit with a handful of workers and today we are proud to say that we are one of the oldest processing units in the MIDC, Bhosari, Pune industrial area, delivery superior quality services.

        <br>Prasho Engineers provides services such as Shot Blasting, Epoxy Coating and P.U. (Polyurethane) Coating on a wide range of materials like — Fibre, Wood, Ferrous and Non-Ferrous, etc., while Jaydee Enterprises handles our Powder Coating division.

        <p> Late Mr. Prakash Kolhatkar is the founder member and patron of Prasho Engineers.
            Born on November 09, 1940, he came from Sangli to Pune at the age of 23 in pursuit of success in the field of commerce. He initially worked as the Chief Accountant at Bajaj Electricals for 4-5 years, then joined Trimurti Sahakari Bank as the Bank Manager.
            <br>Finances always lured him and this is where the idea of starting his own bank was born. Along-with his colleagues, he started Sharada Sahakari Bank in 1980 at the age of 35. Soon after exploring the Bank Management sector, he decided to launch a different and independent venture. 

            <br> To learn the basics and do his ground research, he worked at Spartan Fabricators for a few years and then, in 1982, at the age of 42, he started his own Processing Unit at Bhosari MIDC, by the name — Prasho Engineers.
            <br>The field was entirely new for him had no technical background but had tremendous desire to learn new things and a strong urge to succeed. Since then, he has never looked back and has set a new benchmark of quality in Shot Blasting Epoxy Coating, P.U. (Polyurethane) Coating and Powder Coating. He made new services available at the unit such as — Coating on Fibre, Wood, Ferrous and Non-Ferrous materials and over a period of time, he has upgraded the machinery and gadgetry to keep pace with the changing technology. 
            <br>In every business, there are always highs and lows but he never compromised on quality to cut costs. Punctuality, hard work, honesty and customer centric approach have always been his strong points and the same has percolated down to the workers. We have the lowest attrition rate in the industry with a few workers being with us for 30 plus years. He always has been a great support to all our staff members and workers and has strongly stood behind each one of them during their times of crisis  — this is what keeps the Prasho family together.
            <br>Even though today, he is not with us, he will always motivate us to achieve new heights for the company and to continuously upgrade our facility. He was an inspiration and will always stay one!
